# Document Intelligence System - Approach Explanation

## Methodology Overview

Our document intelligence system employs a multi-stage approach to extract and prioritize relevant sections from PDF documents based on user persona and job-to-be-done requirements.

## Core Components

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Uses PyPDF2 to extract text page-by-page from input documents
- **Section Segmentation**: Employs regex patterns to identify logical document sections (Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, etc.)
- **Content Filtering**: Removes sections with insufficient content (< 50 characters) to focus on substantial material

### 2. Relevance Scoring Algorithm
The system calculates relevance scores using a hybrid approach:

**Keyword Matching (40% weight)**: Extracts keywords from persona and job descriptions, then counts occurrences in document sections. This captures direct topical alignment.

**TF-IDF Similarity (60% weight)**: Implements cosine similarity between the persona-job query and section content using TF-IDF vectorization. This captures semantic relevance beyond exact keyword matches.

The weighted combination ensures both literal and conceptual relevance are considered.

### 3. Content Refinement
- **Sentence Scoring**: Ranks sentences by position weight (earlier = more important) and keyword density
- **Intelligent Summarization**: Selects top-scoring sentences within length constraints (500 characters)
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains coherent narrative flow in refined sections

## Technical Optimizations

### Performance Constraints
- **CPU-Only Architecture**: Uses lightweight scikit-learn TF-IDF instead of heavy transformer models
- **Memory Efficiency**: Processes documents sequentially and limits feature vectors to 1000 dimensions
- **Speed Optimization**: Implements early stopping in text refinement and limits section analysis to top 10 results

### Model Selection Rationale
We chose classical NLP techniques over modern language models due to:
- Model size constraint (â‰¤ 1GB)
- CPU-only requirement
- 60-second processing time limit
- No internet access restriction

## Output Structure
The system generates structured JSON output containing:
- Metadata with processing context
- Ranked relevant sections with importance scores
- Refined subsection analysis with condensed, high-value content

This approach balances accuracy, speed, and resource constraints while providing actionable insights tailored to specific user needs and document collections.
